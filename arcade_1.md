I didn't receive any content to convert. Tell me what you want imported into GitBook and how you'd like it processed.

Please provide one of the following:

* A URL to the page to import (I will preserve all links and query parameters).
* The page HTML or Markdown content to convert.

Also tell me any preferences (optional):

* Keep images as-is or list them separately.
* Prefer stepper/tab conversion for numbered steps or package-manager code blocks (I'll convert automatically per rules).
* Any particular title or target filepath in GitBook.

Once you send the content or URL I'll convert it to GitBook-optimized Markdown following your rules (tabs for npm/yarn/pnpm blocks, stepper for multi-step lists, FAQ -> expandables, remove navigation noise, etc.).
